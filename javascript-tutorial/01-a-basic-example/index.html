    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused primarily by human activities. The main driver is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities release these gases, accelerating global warming.</p>

    <p>The consequences of climate change are widespread. Rising global temperatures are leading to more frequent heatwaves, stronger storms, and shifting weather patterns. Melting ice caps and glaciers are contributing to rising sea levels, which threaten coastal cities and ecosystems. Changes in temperature also disrupt ecosystems and biodiversity, pushing some species to extinction and affecting agriculture, with unpredictable growing seasons and reduced crop yields.</p>

    <p>Addressing climate change involves two main approaches: mitigation, which focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy and energy efficiency, and adaptation, which aims to prepare for the inevitable impacts through resilient infrastructure and conservation efforts. International cooperation is essential to limit global warming and mitigate the damage to both the environment and human society.</p>
