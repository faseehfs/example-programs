#include <iostream>
// This line includes the standard input-output stream library in our program,
// which allows the program to perform input and output operations.
// iostream (input-output stream) is a part of the C++ standard library (or STL).
// The iostream library contains the definitions for `cin` (used to get input) and
// `cout` (used to give output).
// You will understand how `cout` is used in this example.

int main()
{
    // This line declares the main function.
    // The main function code goes inside "{}".
    // In C++, every program must have a main function to operate,
    // which serves as the entry point for execution.
    // The end of the main function is the end of the program.

    // The int before main() indicates that the function returns an
    // integer value. (int stands for integer).
    // You don't need to bother much about that int and returning an integer value.
    // Most people get stuck on this line and just get depressed.
    // You will understand it easily what it means as you go along.
    // For now, just remember that int before the main function
    // says the main function returns an integer.

    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    // `cout` can be thought of as the standard output device (usually the console).
    // We need to prefix `cout` with `std::` as the cout object belongs to the
    // C++ standard library or STL.
    // << is the insertion operator. It just inserts whatever is on its right into
    // whatever is on its left.
    // Here, << inserts "Hello World!" into `cout` (the standard output device).
    // `endl` is the newline character.
    // First, "Hello World" gets inserted into the `cout` then the `endl`, and the
    // cursor goes to the next line.
    // We need to prefix `endl` with `std::` like we did with `cout` as it also
    // belongs to the standard library.

    return 0;
    // This line marks the end of the main function.
    // Every function gets terminated when it returns something.
