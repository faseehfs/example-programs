from tkinter import *  # "*" addresses everything in the tkinter library, and we are importing everything in it.

# In tkinter, everything is a widget. eg: a button.

root = Tk()  # Assigning the root widget as "Tk", which is the window.

# Creating Widgets.
MyLabelWidget1 = Label(
    root, text="Hello World!"
)  # Creating a Label Widget. "Label()" is a function to create Label Widgets. "root" inside "()" says the destination of the widget is in the root.
MyLabelWidget2 = Label(root, text="Iam a Tkinter programme.")

# Packing Widgets.
MyLabelWidget1.grid(
    row=0, column=0
)  # Istead of ".pack()" function, we use the ".grid()" function.
MyLabelWidget2.grid(row=1, column=0)


# We can create and pack widgets in a single line. See:
MyLabelWidget3 = Label(root, text="These are Text Widgets.").grid(
    row=3, column=2
)  # Placed the packing line at the end of the line creating the widget.

root.mainloop()  # Calling root widget (the window) as the main loop.
